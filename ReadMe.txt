Project 1
15 Puzzle Problem

----------

To Run Project_1.py:

1. Ensure that you have numpy installed in your virtual environment
   Note: I used python 3.8 when developing this, if you encounter strange
     issues, make sure that your virtual environment is in 3.8

2. Open the code an IDE of your choosing

3. Set your project directory to wherever you want to output a .txt file

4. (Optional) To change the initial state of the puzzle, see line# 90
   enter your desired initial state inside of np.array()
   Example Format: [[1, 6, 2, 3], [9, 5, 7, 4], [0, 10, 11, 8], [13, 14, 15, 12]]

5. (Optional) To change the output file name, see line# 91
   the value of "testCase" will be added to the end of the output file
   Example: testCase = 5  -->  nodePath_TestCase5.txt

6. Run the code

7. Open the text file to verify results
